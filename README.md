# Customer Segmentation Analysis using RFM Method
This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis on online retail data using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) method using the Python programming language. The data used includes information about customer purchasing behaviour, such as purchase frequency, transaction value, and last purchase time.

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer purchasing behaviour and helps design more effective marketing strategies. By understanding the characteristics of each customer segment, companies can optimise marketing efforts and improve overall customer retention and conversion.

## Problem Statement
In the face of an increasingly competitive market, understanding customer profiles is crucial to designing effective marketing strategies. The main challenge is how to categorise customers into different segments based on their transaction characteristics, in order to design the right strategy to increase retention and conversion.

## Objectives
- Identified existing customer segments based on the RFM method.
- Designed special programmes to increase conversion and transaction numbers from high potential segments.
- Encouraged customers in inactive segments to return to transactions by designing appropriate special programmes, with the aim of increasing their engagement.

## Project Strategics
The customer segmentation analysis was conducted using the RFM method, which divides customers based on three main factors: 
1. Measuring how recently the customer interacted with the business or made a purchase (Recency).
2. Measuring how often the user interacted or made a purchase in a certain period of time (Frequency).
3. Measuring how much total money was spent by the user in a certain period of time (Monetary).
Python is used to implement this analysis, with the help of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scipy.

## Analysis Findings

From the analysis, several significant customer segments were identified:
- Hibernating segment (27.3%): Customers in this segment have low transaction frequency and relatively small monetary value. The appropriate strategy is to design special programs to encourage them to return transactions, with a focus on increasing engagement.
- Champion segment (14.1%): Customers in this segment have high transaction frequency and large monetary value. The strategic focus for this segment is to maintain a high level of engagement and ensure that they continue to feel valued as loyal customers.
- Loyal Customers Segment (14.0%): Customers in this segment have stable transaction frequency and value. To increase conversions, special programs can be implemented to encourage them to transact more frequently, with a focus on increasing the urgency of transactions.
- Potential Loyalists segment (13.4%): Customers in this segment have the potential to become loyal customers, but have not yet shown a high level of engagement. The appropriate strategy is to design a special program that encourages increased transaction frequency, with the aim of elevating them to the Champion segment.
