# Customer Segmentation Analysis using RFM Method
In an increasingly competitive online retail era, understanding customer behavior and needs is key to maintaining a competitive advantage. Therefore, a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) method was conducted on an online retail dataset. This data covers transactions from a specific time period and provides valuable insights to improve the effectiveness of marketing and customer retention strategies.

## Project Strategics
The customer segmentation analysis was conducted using the RFM method, which divides customers based on three main factors: 
1. Measuring how recently the customer interacted with the business or made a purchase (Recency).
2. Measuring how often the user interacted or made a purchase in a certain period of time (Frequency).
3. Measuring how much total money was spent by the user in a certain period of time (Monetary).
Python is used to implement this analysis, with the help of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scipy.

## Analysis Findings

From the analysis, several significant customer segments were identified:
- Hibernating segment (27.3%): Customers in this segment have low transaction frequency and relatively small monetary value. The appropriate strategy is to design special programs to encourage them to return transactions, with a focus on increasing engagement.
- Champion segment (14.1%): Customers in this segment have high transaction frequency and large monetary value. The strategic focus for this segment is to maintain a high level of engagement and ensure that they continue to feel valued as loyal customers.
- Loyal Customers Segment (14.0%): Customers in this segment have stable transaction frequency and value. To increase conversions, special programs can be implemented to encourage them to transact more frequently, with a focus on increasing the urgency of transactions.
- Potential Loyalists segment (13.4%): Customers in this segment have the potential to become loyal customers, but have not yet shown a high level of engagement. The appropriate strategy is to design a special program that encourages increased transaction frequency, with the aim of elevating them to the Champion segment.
